Question 7: 

The largest discrepancy in amino acid counts between the coding sequences (correct frame shift)
and the whole genome sequence (random frame shift) is Stp ("Stop codon"), with the largest
difference of 762. The correct frame shift only has 12 Stp whereas the random frame shift has
774. The reason why we have 12 Stp for the correct frame shift is that we only have 12 separate
genes; each gene has a stopping codon. Additionally, we ignored the last extra remainder (1 or 2)
letters from the gene, whereas the whole genome sequence includes those remainders in,
shifting and messing up the frame with a total of 762 stopping codons.
